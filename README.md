# Turtle Race Game
This is a simple Turtle Race game built using Python's `turtle` module. Players can bet on which turtle will win the race, and the program will simulate the race and announce the winner. If the player's guess is correct, they win the game.

## Features
- **Turtle Race Simulation**: 8 turtles race across the screen, each moving at random speeds.
- **Betting System**: Players can bet on which turtle will win by typing the color of the turtle they think will win.
- **Winner Announcement**: Displays whether the player's guess was correct or not once the race ends.

## How to Play
1. Launch the game, and a prompt will ask you to bet on which turtle will win the race.
2. Type the color of the turtle you think will win.
3. Watch the turtles race! The first turtle to cross the finish line wins.
4. The game will announce if you guessed correctly or not.
